### Abstract

Socket.io is build on top of WebSockets but not limited to it. It will use WebSockets, long pullings or others technologies based on the time what resources you have when you're trying to initiate a communication.

It behaves very similarly to WebSockets and it does a lot of work such as handling reconnections for you, which is retty awesome.
