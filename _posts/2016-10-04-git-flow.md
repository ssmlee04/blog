# {{ page.title }}

Once there are many people working on the same project it is essential that the team can develop a methodology to work together. Git is easy to manage when you're working on your own branch but later on you will have to work with others so a standard practice `gitflow` is propsed that works as follows.

`git pull --rebase origin master`

You might be working on your own branch and the `origin/master` might have moved. In order not to create any superfluous merge commits you can do this as if your branch is branched out from the new origin/master.
