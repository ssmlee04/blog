### tell us what makes you unique

I passed 4 actuarial exams in 1 settings. I single-handedly created an app called singlebeep.com and get some 500 users to use it overnight. I developed an ERP and my client really really liked it. I think I am the kind of person that can get things done. 

### Describe a situation that you’re in a leading position and you need to solve the conflicts
We're developing an editor application and me and my colleagues have different opinions about how to proceed. I think ..., he thinks .... But it's kind of opvious we have to do it the way we described. 

### Have you ever had a conflict with a boss or superior
Yes, when I have good ideas I would communicate with them. Sometimes they would discuss with me about the ideas and let me do it, while sometimes they just ignore it completely. 
The thing is I am doing this for the good of the company, so it’s frustrating that your boss doesn’t want to use something better. So I would try to communicate with my boss again in person or by email and explain to them why I think things should be done my way other than the older way. But after that I would do whatever my boss says. 

### So, tell me a little about yourself.
Hi, my name is Shih-Min. I have a master’s degree in Actuarial Science in U of Michigan. And I have a bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering in National Taiwan University. I love dealing with numbers and complicated things, and I have much experience dealing with a lot of numbers and programming in the past few years. My current job function includes setting up a service so that our clients can schedule contents to play on their signage applications, since I am working as a full-stack developer I have learn so much about stuff in the backend, frontend and deployment. I also had a chance to develop an anonymous chat app using react-native and get like 500 users to use it within a short period of time, and I also had a chance to develop an ERP for my customer using xampp as the framework. So I really spend a lot of time coding stuff.

### What do you think about overtime? 
It think it's alright.

### What relevant experience do you have

### Have you done anything to further your experience

### If your previous co-workers were here, what would they say about you?
My colleagues would say I am easy to communicate with and is not afraid of taking on challenges to help the team grow and improve. 

### Where else have you applied

### How are you when you're working under pressure
I think I can deal with pressures really well. Actually I am under pressure all of time cause I am married. But I would try to prioritize the things that I want to do and do them one by one. It also dependes on where the pressure is from. If the pressure is from our clients and then that's easy. You would have to sort things out eventually and move forward.

### What motivates you?
Being able to solve difficult problems with the skills I got is really satisfying. Also the prospect of doing something that makes a difference to the world is something really motivational too.

### Best quote

The rumor that I am building a space ship to go back to my home planet is simply not true.

### Can you tell me about a time when you handled many things at the same time?
I am always multitasking. When I was taking my master’s degree I had to take 4 actuarial exams in one setting, apply for internships, study the school works and apply for scholarships, too. Which all yields positive results. When I was working in the US I have to multitask on projects during my work hour, after work I’ll try to enrich my finance knowledge by building websites for Taiwan stock trading, trade Taiwan stocks, read finance magazines or watch CNBC to stay connected, also I had to study for my CFA Level 1 exam. 

### Can you give me an example of an experience of failure?
I was working very hard to get a finance job in the US. I tried to pass as many actuarial exams as possible. I tried to go to as many career fairs and do as many mock interviews as possible. And at the same time I take care of my school work well. But I couldn’t find a job anyhow. It is the biggest failure that ever happens to me. What I learned is that I learn to see things in a different perspective. And I later realized this is not necessarily a failure, it might be an opportunity to calm down and think again my career path again. 

### What's your greatest strength, what's your biggest weakness
My biggest strength is I have good reasoning abilities. My education is all about seeing a problem in different perspectives and dissects and solves a problem using analytical reasoning skills I learned in school. 
My greatest weakness is that I am a hasty people. I want to get things done as soon and perfectly as possible. Although I can finish a task with perfection, but sometimes at the cost of wasting time and lose focus on a bigger scale. 

### Let's talk about salary. What are you looking for
Based on my background I would expect something around 50000-60000. But for me money is not the biggest issue. Right now my priority is learning about this industry as fast as possible so if I have the opportunity to really learn something and get exposure then I’d consider every offer seriously. 

### Are you willing to put the interests of X Company ahead of your own
Yes, I am sure that’s the best and definite way to learn and grow with a company. 

### Why do you think you can succeed in this role. 
I developed critical thinking and analytical reason skills during my studies and in the one year working experience in the US. Also, I am fluent in both English and Chinese. I can communicate with people in the US and China easily and I know about their culture compared to average candidates. Since I don’t have much experience in the finance industry, I am willing to working harder and I will be passionate to learn everything as soon as possible so that I can stay competitive in this industry. I think those are qualities to be successful in the company. 

### So, explain why I should hire you
I have a solid background in mathematics, programming, finance and engineering and from which I developed critical thinking skills. 
I am a fast learner, hard-working and self-motivated person. And I can multitask easily during to my past training. Also, I am an easy-going person and I like to interact with people because from doing so I learn the good things from others that I don’t have. Also, I can communicate in English and Chinese fluently. Finally I’d like to say that I have been waiting for an opportunity in the finance industry. I believe what I have learned and my passion would continue to be a great asset to your company. 

### What does hard work mean to you 
To get a better understand about the industry or get promoted I think working hard is inevitable. So If I have a chance to accomplish something great or fulfill myself, then I actually welcome hard work and see it as an opportunity.

### Describe some situations that really bother you 
When I was working as a programmer in the previous company, I have a difficult time collaborating with my colleague’s work. Because my company doesn’t have strict coding disciplines to follow. All of the programmers are working in their own ways. It’s very hard to integrate everyone’s code like this much less coming up with good results. That bothers me a lot. So I’ll email my superior and see if we could improve some of the coding disciplines like what I learned in school. I’ll discuss with him about the efficiency of our code and see if there could be better ideas or algorithms to solve the problem. Sometimes we would come up with very useful comments and I am sure it’s very helpful to the company as a whole, too. 

### Have you ever in some kind of competition
What do you like most about working with others? What least? 
I like working in the environment that I can have direct communication with the other people, this way I am constantly learning new ideas and experience from people around me. That’s what I like the most about working with others.

### What motivates you? DONE

I think I was motivated by a lot of things such as the beautiful models behind the formulas, direct contacts with human beings and the robustness and the rapidity of a real market. I was doing EE before, and I was dealing with IC chips all the time. One day I occasionally find out it’s been a while that I stopped talking to people that I become so tacit even when I was with my best friends. I realized this is not the life I wanted. It’s unsatisfying. Also I took a lot of pure math courses before; I kept asking where those skills could be applied on. And one day by accident I took the course “financial mathematics” and I saw the BS formulas, the interest rate models I realized those analytical skills can actually be used on a real market. It’s quite amazing; I think that motivates me a lot!


### What interests you about this position, industry and organization?

Yesterday when I was in the Swiss re life session I learned that you guys say because you’re dealing with reinsurance from many other companies so that enables you to see a lot of different products and ideas and that interest me a lot. I guess this is quite an effective way to approach the life insurance field. 

### How does it make you feel if you don’t get to finish a job?
If I failed to finish a job I would see it as a personal failure and would be upset about it for a period of time. But I would learn from past experience to see where my failure lies and try to improve my efficiency so that I wouldn’t have to regret about it again and again.
