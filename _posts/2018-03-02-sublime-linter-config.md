So you need to make sure

- node is installed and Sublime Text 3 can find it under `/usr/local/bin/node`

If you're installing node using nvm you might want to do this:

```sh
sudo ln -s /Users/username/.nvm/versions/node/v7.6.0/bin/node /usr/local/bin/node
```

Also make sure the specified node version is installed.
