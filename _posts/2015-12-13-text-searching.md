### Abstract

let's say your one of your mongodb document looks like this

```
{
  address: "8001 Benaroya Ln, Huntsville, AL 35802",
  name: "Mex's pork chop"
  industry_id: ObjectId("123412341234123412341234"),
  description: {
    "en": "pig",
    "de": "schwein",
    "ch": "è±¬æŽ’"
  }
}
```

The most intuitive way to do is to search all the fields in the document and index all the fields for better matches. Althought many times this is just not a right thing to do.

### Basic indexing

Create an index on 1 field:

```
db.collection.createIndex({"name":"text"})
```

Index on multiple fields:

```
db.collection.createIndex({"name":"text", "description.en":"text"})
```

Index on all fields:

```
db.collection.createIndex({"$**":"text"})
```

Note that indexing on all fields will make your query slow at times. In general you don't want to do it.

### full text search limitations

If you text search "pigs", "schweine" they will work.  But if you search "schweinen", "è±¬" they will not work. mongodb text search is not very efficient for dealing with unicode type text search or plurals.
