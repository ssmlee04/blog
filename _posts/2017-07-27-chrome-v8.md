# {{ page.title }}

### Abstract

- V8 is an open sourced Javascript engine for web browsers.
- V8 compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code before executing it.
- The compiled code is additionally optimized (and re-optimized) dynamically at runtime (Inlining)
- Garbage collection is done more efficiently. Instead of doing the freeze-it-all mark-and-sweep it does garbage collection incrementally now. And the sweep phase is done by separate threads.
