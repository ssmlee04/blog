### Api blueprint

Api blueprint is a tool that emphasizes a design-first philosophy for you to create your api in a more sensible way.

### Integrations

- dredd

So you can use `dredd` to test your apis based on your api blueprint. It can be integrated with the CI easily.

- apiary

It seems you can use `apiary` to generate the documentations as well as your mock api responses for your api even before you have your application running.
