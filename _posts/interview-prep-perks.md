### Assume you want to implement a function: update the virus pattern and patch to computer around the world, what would you consider and what strategy would you use? anything.

I could setup a websocket or a polling service that listens to software updates. For a simple system you can probably use a mac_address as the identifier for the access management. Once you have updated the virus pattern the latest virus pattern version would be the same as that on the server.

### how would you test a website without any test tools?

I would probably do the following things:

* check the response time and resource size
* maximum load the website can handle

### How would you test a pen?

* verify what kind of pen it is (say, crayon)
* who is expected to use the pen (say, children)
* what kind of specs does it have (it does wash off, it has many colors)
* safety would be an issue (test for poisoning, test for integrity, test for extreme weather conditions)
