### <font color='red'>history, economy, philosophy</font>

* 香港企業併購經典 (2015)

it's a book on M&A cases in Hongkong during 1960s-1980s.  You see how big corporations success and fail by making decisions under different circumstances.  Food for thought.

* 夢遊者 1914 - 歐洲如何邁向戰爭之路 (2015)

It's a great book I'd recommend anyone who's interested in world politics.  I also find it ridiculous that human repeat their mistakes and go into wars again and again.

* 野心時代 (2015)

Know most of the stuff in there already..

Turns out this guy graduates from Duke and is much more than just a 21 gambler..

### <font color='red'>novels</font>

Wonder if those things are true. Recommended.

...
