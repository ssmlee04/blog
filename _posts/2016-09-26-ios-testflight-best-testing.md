### Abstract

Before you release your apps to the market you certainly want to fully test your apps and make sure everything is Ok. Apple provides 2 types of testing. One is internal testing and the other one is external testing.

You can configure which builds to release to beta testing and stuff.

Apple would send those testers an email and they can simply download the app from somewhere.

You would be receiving information about installs, crashes from the testers.
