### Abstract

Vault has becoming a popular secret management tool nowadays. You can use it to manage rolling password, access managements, auditing... etc. It can also be integrated into CI/CD pipelines so you would have a centralized place to store your credentials securely and easily.

### Misc

- You need to host your own vault servers.
- You can seal / unseal the vault with multiple keys. This prevents the risk of single person having the key and destroys everything.
