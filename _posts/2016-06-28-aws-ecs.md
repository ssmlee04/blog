You can monitor metrics like the number of running containers, cpu and memory usage of a cluster. In theory the number of running containers would equal to the number of running EC2 instance that is scale automatically.

- Task

A task is used to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS. A task may spread to multiple EC2 instances and the relationship is monitored by something called ECS service. 

- Services

A service auto-recovers any stopped tasks to maintain the desired number of tasks that you specify.
